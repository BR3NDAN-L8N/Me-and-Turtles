                When I was young I saw a cartoon that featured a turtle. I don't remember the name of the show or the turtles name but I think he was green. Anyways, the turtle in the show went into it's shell. The camera showed the inside of his shell and it was a full living room. The turtle was sitting in a recliner reading a newspaper and close by there was a lit fireplace. I thought that was the coolest thing and turtles became my favorite animal. I haven't given much thought to a new favorite animal so I default to turtles with living rooms in their shell.
